Shooter Game Expansion, with 3 new features:
1. Freezing gun.
2. Shrink gun.
3. Weapon drop on death.
The new features support both PvP and PvE (bots have been adjusted to incorporate these new features as well).

Please notice that the maps built data is in seperate folder, due to the size of the files. Those files cannot be uploaded to git even with the use of LFS.
The built project along with the maps built data can be found in the link: https://1drv.ms/u/s!AnaMNiSJxQU_huwwA8O9e2y8KOV8RA?e=Wrah85.
